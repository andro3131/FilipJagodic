      "p1": "Filip Jagodič was born after severe complications in the fifth month of pregnancy. His path has been extraordinarily challenging from the very beginning. The diagnoses — blindness, cerebral palsy, and a form of autism — would have stopped many, but Filip showed exceptional will and talent from the start.",
      "p2": "By the age of one, he began singing songs — without words, but with flawless melody. When he got a toy with keys, his true musical journey began. Filip started playing everything he heard. No one taught him — he learned everything himself, with 100% perfect pitch.",
      "blockquote": "\u201CNo one teaches me. I learned everything by myself.\u201D",
      "p3": "Today, Filip knows thousands of songs — from jazz standards of the 1920s, chansons and pop songs from the 50s and 60s, to modern hits. He can instantly reproduce any song he hears on keyboards and sing it with all the voices. He also has the extraordinary ability to sing a song backwards — reversing both the lyrics and melody entirely. In the recording studio, he can record over 30 songs in a single session.",
      "p4": "Filip has recorded three CDs and in 2018 had a sold-out solo concert in Trebnje. He has no stage fright on stage — as he says: \u201CI have no stage fright, I'm not afraid. I can't see the people.\u201D This directness is part of his charm that captivates everyone he meets — from ordinary listeners to the biggest stars, like Andrea Bocelli.",
      "p5": "Besides music, Filip has another great passion — he collects synthesizers and dictaphones. His collection includes more than 20 keyboards, and he knows each one inside out. His biggest wish remains the Yamaha Tyros 5 — a professional keyboard that would open new musical worlds for him.",
      "p6": "Behind Filip stands his devoted mother Andreja Pader, who provides him with daily support and care. Together they are an unstoppable team — Filip with his talent, Andreja with boundless love and determination.",

He was so impressed that he kept Filip's USB stick with the recording as a memento. A moment that Filip and his family will never forget."
