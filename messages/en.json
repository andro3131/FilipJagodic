Despite blindness, cerebral palsy, and autism, he developed an extraordinary musical talent — 100% perfect pitch. By the age of one, he was already singing melodies, and when he got a toy with keys, he began playing everything he heard.",

      "pageDescription": "The full life story of Filip Jagodič — from birth to today.",
      "ch1title": "Birth and Hospital",
      "ch1p1": "Filip's mother Andreja had wished for a child since she was twenty, but her wish only came true at thirty-one. The pregnancy was normal until the fifth month, and even three days before birth the ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Then her water suddenly broke.",
      "ch1p2": "Filip Jagodič was born in the fifth month of pregnancy by cesarean section — without it, neither he nor his mother would have survived. At birth he weighed just 600 grams. He cried softly, like a tiny kitten, and was immediately placed on artificial respiration. He was tiny, with a peculiar little head, and his skin was so thin you could see his heart and lungs.",
      "ch1q": "\u201CWe waited for him to cry, and he did — he cried softly, like a tiny kitten.\u201D",
      "ch2title": "Diagnoses",
      "ch2p1": "Filip's path was extraordinarily challenging from the very beginning. First they discovered blindness. Then cerebral palsy. At age three, he was also diagnosed with autism — Asperger's syndrome. Each diagnosis was a new blow, but mother Andreja went through all the stages of acceptance and decided to give her son the best possible life.",
      "ch3title": "Rehabilitation",
      "ch3p1": "For twelve years they drove him to therapy in Zagreb, where they fitted him with braces to try to get him on his feet — but it didn't work. His mother exercised with him every day for five hours. Others were swimming in the sea, while we were doing exercises — she said. For ten years she drove him five times a week from Laško to Ljubljana to the Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired. On the way he would sometimes have an asthma attack and she would stand in the middle of the road.",
      "ch3q": "\u201CI exercised with him every day for five hours. Others were swimming in the sea, while we were doing exercises.\u201D",
      "ch4title": "Father",
      "ch4p1": "Sadly, Filip's father is no longer with us — he passed away when the little boy was only eight years old. To this day, Filip goes to bed the same way every evening, with three kisses — a kiss for mommy, a kiss for daddy, and a kiss from Filip for both.",
      "ch5title": "Musical Talent",
      "ch5p1": "By the age of one, Filip began singing songs — without words, but with flawless melody. When he got a toy with keys, his true musical journey began. Filip started playing everything he heard. No one taught him — he learned everything himself, with 100% perfect pitch.",
      "ch5q": "\u201CNo one teaches me. I learned everything by myself.\u201D",
      "ch5p2": "Today, Filip knows thousands of songs — from jazz standards of the 1920s, chansons and pop songs from the 50s and 60s, to modern hits. He can instantly reproduce any song he hears on keyboards and sing it with all the voices. He also has the extraordinary ability to sing a song backwards — reversing both the lyrics and melody entirely. In the recording studio, he can record over 30 songs in a single session.",
      "ch6title": "Autistic Traits",
      "ch6p1": "Autistic people are obsessed with order. Every toy must be in its place, every synthesizer he has been collecting for 15 years must be exactly where it belongs. His perfectionism is a consequence of autism — Filip recognizes many Slovenian songs that are plagiarized and tells the musicians straight to their face. That's who he is: honest, direct.",
      "ch6q": "\u201CI believe his perfectionism is a consequence of autism. Filip recognizes many Slovenian songs that are plagiarized.\u201D",
      "ch6p2": "With his abilities, Filip is reminiscent of one of the most famous autistic musicians in the world — Derek Paravicini, a blind British pianist who has also performed at Cankarjev dom in Ljubljana. Both are proof that autism and blindness are not obstacles, but doors to an extraordinary musical world.",
      "ch7title": "Career",
      "ch7p1": "Filip has recorded three CDs and has had numerous concerts throughout Slovenia. He has no stage fright — as he says: \u201CI have no stage fright, I'm not afraid. I can't see the people.\u201D This directness is part of his energy that captivates everyone who meets him — from ordinary listeners to the biggest stars, like Andrea Bocelli.",
      "ch8title": "Mother Andreja",
      "ch8p1": "Behind Filip stands his devoted mother Andreja Pader. She survived cancer twice, nearly died from a blocked abdominal aorta, but never gave up. She worked as a doctor while simultaneously caring for Filip. For twelve years she traveled to Zagreb for her son's therapy. She devoted all her time and energy to him. Today she herself needs help — her health problems are a consequence of years of caregiving, but her fight for Filip never stops.",
      "ch8q": "\u201CMy life turned upside down in an instant; before I wanted a career, I took care of animals, and overnight I became just a mother. And my husband overnight lost his wife, which I also mourn.\u201D",
      "ch8p2": "Andreja is also one of the most vocal critics of the personal assistance system in Slovenia. She fights against shortcomings in legislation and the indifference of commissions that decide on the rights of children with special needs. Her fight is not just for Filip — but for all families who find themselves in a similar situation.",
      "ch8p3": "Together they are an unstoppable team — Filip with his talent, Andreja with boundless love and determination.",
      "ch9title": "Filip Today",
      "ch9p1": "Besides music, Filip has another great passion — he collects synthesizers and dictaphones. His collection includes more than 20 keyboards, and he knows each one inside out, while his room houses around 2,000 CDs. His biggest wish remains the Yamaha Tyros 5 — a professional keyboard that would open new musical worlds for him.",
      "ch9p2": "Filip requires 24-hour personal assistance. Three assistants — Jernej, Dejan, and Rok — help him in his daily life. Jernej and Filip are like twins, Dejan is the computer expert, and Rok helps out in the field. Without them, Filip's life wouldn't be what it is.",
      "ch9p3": "Every evening Filip goes to bed the same way, with three kisses. His world is orderly, full of music and love. And although life with him is demanding, Filip is proof that talent knows no boundaries.",

He does everything exclusively by touch — he plays keyboards and sings simultaneously, without sheet music, without preparation. He nails 99% of songs on the first take. In a single recording session, he can record over 30 songs.",
    "storyP2": "There's a lot of joking in the studio — Filip loves speaking in English (just for fun) and the atmosphere is always relaxed. But when he presses a key and opens his mouth, every recording is pure magic.",
    "storyP3": "Filip has also recorded several duets. With Barbara Leben, he recorded the original song Privid, and with Agnes Kumlanc an energetic cover of Prsti zapleteni. A special duet was with blind girl Mija Koritnik — two voices, the same sensitivity for music. He also sang with Jernej Golob, one of his assistants.",
